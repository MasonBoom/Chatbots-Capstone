# Generative-chatbot
This is my first generative chatbot project I have ever made. This was the final capstone of Codecademy's "Build Chatbots with Python" skill path.

this is a generative, open-domain chatbot to allow it to interact with the user and talk about numerous subjects, instead of being confined to predetermined topics. The chatbot reads the user input to generate a response based on what the user types into the console.

To run this project locally, run the file "chat.py". I reccomend setting up tensorflow-gpu prior to running this program on your local machine.

I built this project using:
- Python 3
- Anaconda3
- Tensorflow
- Keras
- itertools
- numpy

Here is a sample of text generated by the bot's responses to user input:
